#  File   : startup
#  Author : Larry Frieson
#  Desc   : startup is a driver dispatcher script used on the MVI56E-LDM.  This script
#           will start the LDM driver declared below.  To stop the driver, it will call
#           kill on any of the the running instance of the driver.  This is just one of
#           the many ways to start and stop an LDM driver. Please visit:
#           https://gitlab.com/psft/mvi56e-ldm for more information and examples.
